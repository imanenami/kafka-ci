This causes unbounded recursion in the lookup_handle_cname function, leading to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability affects record browsers where AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_MULTICAST is set explicitly, which includes record browsers created by resolvers used by nss-mdns.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the

This causes unbounded recursion in the lookup_handle_cname function, leading to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability affects record browsers where AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_MULTICAST is set explicitly, which includes record browsers created by resolvers used by nss-mdns.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI\n differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be \nconsidered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks.", "Severity": "MEDIUM", "CweIDs": ["CWE-1286"], "VendorSeverity": {"ghsa": 2, "nvd": 2, "redhat": 1, "ubuntu": 2}, "CVSS": {"ghsa": {"V3Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "V3Score": 3.7}, "nvd": {"V3Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "V3Score": 5.3}, "redhat": {"V3Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "V3Score": 3.7}}, "References": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6763", "https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project", "https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/12012", "https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qh8g-58pp-2wxh", "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/25", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6763", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250306-0005", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250306-0005/", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6763"], "PublishedDate": "2024-10-14T16:15:04.163Z", "LastModifiedDate": "2025-07-10T15:04:04.103Z", "Target": "Java", "Class": "lang-pkgs", "Product": "zookeeper-rock@3-22.04"}, {"VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2024-13009", "PkgName": "org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server", "PkgPath": "opt/zookeeper/lib/jetty-server-9.4.53.v20231009.jar", "PkgIdentifier": {"PURL": "pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-server@9.4.53.v20231009", "UID": "7b7957aca06ef4ce"}, "InstalledVersion": "9.4.53.v20231009", "FixedVersion": "9.4.57.v20241219", "Status": "fixed", "Layer": {"DiffID": "sha256:f7a36c721193b1e5e0bea4fa6db5aa28048628d5565d06ece87a1be03208998e"}, "SeveritySource": "ghsa", "PrimaryURL": "https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-13009", "DataSource": {"ID": "ghsa", "Name": "GitHub Security Advisory Maven", "URL": "https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Amaven"}, "Title": "jetty-server: Jetty: Gzip Request Body Buffer Corruption", "Description": "In Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0 to 9.4.56 a buffer can be incorrectly released when confronted with a gzip error when inflating a request\nbody.
