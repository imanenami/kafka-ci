too large an alignment to the memalign suite of functions (memalign, posix_memalign, aligned_alloc) in the GNU C Library version 2.30 to 2.42 may result in an integer overflow, which could consequently result in a heap corruption.\n\nNote that the attacker must have control over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able to exploit this.  The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow size_t along with the large alignment argument.  This limits the malicious inputs for the alignment for memalign to the range [1<<62+ 1, 1<<63] and exactly 1<<63 for posix_memalign and aligned_alloc.\n\nTypically the alignment argument passed to such functions is a known constrained quantity (e.g. page size, block size, struct sizes) and is not attacker controlled, because of which this may not be easily exploitable in practice.  An application bug could potentially result in the input alignment being too large, e.g. due to a different buffer overflow or integer overflow in the application or its dependent libraries, but that is again an uncommon usage pattern given typical sources of alignments.", "Severity": "MEDIUM", "CweIDs": ["CWE-190"], "VendorSeverity": {"alma": 2, "cbl-mariner": 2, "oracle-oval": 2, "photon": 3,

Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

large an alignment to the memalign suite of functions (memalign, posix_memalign, aligned_alloc) in the GNU C Library version 2.30 to 2.42 may result in an integer overflow, which could consequently result in a heap corruption.\n\nNote that the attacker must have control over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able to exploit this.  The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow size_t along with the large alignment argument.  This limits the malicious inputs for the alignment for memalign to the range [1<<62+ 1, 1<<63] and exactly 1<<63 for posix_memalign and aligned_alloc.\n\nTypically the alignment argument passed to such functions is a known constrained quantity (e.g. page size, block size, struct sizes) and is not attacker controlled, because of which this may not be easily exploitable in practice.  An application bug could potentially result in the input alignment being too large, e.g. due to a different buffer overflow or integer overflow in the application or its dependent libraries, but that is again an uncommon usage pattern given typical sources of alignments.", "Severity": "MEDIUM", "CweIDs": ["CWE-190"], "VendorSeverity": {"alma": 2, "cbl-mariner": 2, "oracle-oval": 2, "photon": 3, "redhat": 1, "rocky": 2, "ubuntu": 2}, "CVSS": {"redhat": {"V3Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "V3Score": 8.1}}, "References": ["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/5", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2026:1334", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-0861", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2429771", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2430201", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2429771", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2430201", "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2026-0861", "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2026-0915", "https://errata.almalinux.org/10/ALSA-2026-1334.html", "https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2026:1334", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2026-0861.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2026-50078.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0861", "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33796", "https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2026-0001", "https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-8005-1", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0861"], "PublishedDate": "2026-01-14T21:15:52.617Z", "LastModifiedDate": "2026-02-03T18:26:25.39Z", "Target": "/root/kafka-rock-4-24.04.tar (ubuntu 24.04)", "Class": "os-pkgs", "Product": "kafka-rock@4-24.04"}, {"VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2026-0915", "PkgID": "libc6@2.39-0ubuntu8.6", "PkgName": "libc6", "PkgIdentifier": {"PURL": "pkg:deb/ubuntu/libc6@2.39-0ubuntu8.6?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-24.04", "UID": "313a00b6e8efd32a"}, "InstalledVersion": "2.39-0ubuntu8.6", "FixedVersion": "2.39-0ubuntu8.7", "Status": "fixed", "Layer": {"DiffID": "sha256:123a078714d5ea9382d4d9f550753aefce8b34ec5ae11ae8273038d3bcbb943f"}, "SeveritySource": "ubuntu", "PrimaryURL": "https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2026-0915", "DataSource": {"ID": "ubuntu", "Name": "Ubuntu CVE Tracker", "URL": "https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"}, "Title": "glibc: glibc: Information disclosure via zero-valued network query", "Description": "Calling getnetbyaddr or getnetbyaddr_r with a configured nsswitch.conf that specifies the library's DNS backend for networks and queries for a zero-valued network in the GNU C Library version 2.0 to version 2.42 can leak stack contents to the configured DNS resolver.", "Severity": "MEDIUM", "CweIDs": ["CWE-908"], "VendorSeverity": {"alma": 2, "cbl-mariner": 2, "oracle-oval": 2, "photon": 3, "redhat": 2, "rocky": 2, "ubuntu": 2}, "CVSS": {"redhat": {"V3Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "V3Score": 5.3}}, "References": ["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/6", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2026:1334", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-0915", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2429771", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2430201", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2429771", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2430201", "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2026-0861", "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2026-0915", "https://errata.almalinux.org/10/ALSA-2026-1334.html", "https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2026:1334", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2026-0915.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2026-50078.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0915", "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33802", "https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-8005-1", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0915", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/6"], "PublishedDate": "2026-01-15T22:16:12.457Z", "LastModifiedDate": "2026-01-23T19:36:50.73Z", "Target": "/root/kafka-rock-4-24.04.tar (ubuntu 24.04)", "Class": "os-pkgs", "Product": "kafka-rock@4-24.04"}, {"VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2025-8941", "PkgID": "libpam-modules@1.5.3-5ubuntu5.5", "PkgName": "libpam-modules", "PkgIdentifier": {"PURL": "pkg:deb/ubuntu/libpam-modules@1.5.3-5ubuntu5.5?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-24.04", "UID": "a0c2c3cde0600a83"}, "InstalledVersion": "1.5.3-5ubuntu5.5", "Status": "affected", "Layer": {"DiffID": "sha256:123a078714d5ea9382d4d9f550753aefce8b34ec5ae11ae8273038d3bcbb943f"}, "SeveritySource": "ubuntu", "PrimaryURL": "https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2025-8941", "DataSource": {"ID": "ubuntu", "Name": "Ubuntu CVE Tracker", "URL": "https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker"}, "Title": "linux-pam: Incomplete fix for CVE-2025-6020", "Description": "A flaw was found in linux-pam.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the

When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).
