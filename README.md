# What is this?

This is the frontend for a [handy tool](https://imanenami.github.io/kafka-ci) which I wrote to help me monitor DPE Kafka DevSecOps pipelines.

## Where is the backend?

Somewhere hosted on Hetzner servers. I used to use AWS services, but they are freaking expensive for this! You mean the code? I need some time to clean it up and push it to GitHub. But unfortunately it's not a priority for me at the moment.

## Can I use this for my team/project/use-case?

Sure, you can copy the code in part or entirety, no attribution required! Also, if you want your repositories to be added to the scheduled workflows on my backend, just ping me!

## How optimized is this?

Optimization wasn't among my concerns when developing this.

## I have 10 edge cases which this tool doesn't support.

Probably you should either fork and develop your own tool if you find parts of this code useful, or maybe look for another solution. My preference is to KISS.
